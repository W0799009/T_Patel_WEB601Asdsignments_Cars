completed my assignment2 on 10 feb.


Assignment 3

Use your completed assignment 2 as a base line.
Change the version in your package.json to 0.0.3.

Add more content to your array such that you have at least 7 content items. Update your
content items to use one of at least 2 different type values, as well as some with no type set.


Create a pipe (name it some relevant to its functionality), that accepts a single optional string
parameter, to filter an array of Content, only returning Content that has its type equal to a
string passed to the pipe. If no value is passed in, then the pipe returns a filtered array of
Content that has no type set.
Alter the html that displays your on your Content-List component so that it displays
separate lists by type using your pipe (You should have one loop where the type is not passed
into the pipe, and at 2 separate *ngFor loops with the type set, depending how many
different types you decided to use).

Style the lists Content-Card's differently by using different font or background colours for
the card tag itself, based on their type (i.e. one type's content cards could have a green text in
the card, another type's content cards could have a red text in the card, etc). There should be
a clear difference between the colour styling from one card with a certain type versus one with
another type.
On your Content-List component, add an input field at the very top of the page that users
may enter the title of a Content item. Next to the input field, add a button that, when clicked,
it will display a message about whether a Content item exists with that title or not. The
message should be displayed under this search, with red text when the title doesn't exist, and
green text when it does exist.

All done
